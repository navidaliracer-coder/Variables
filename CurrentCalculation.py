#Write a program to calculate the electricity bill. The bill is calculated by checking the number of units consumed. Suppose the user is consuming less than 50 units. The per-unit cost will be 2.60, and the tax on that bill will be 25. If a user is consuming more than 50 but less than 100. Then the per-unit cost will be 3.25, and the tax on that bill will be 35 If the user is coming more than 100 and less than 200. Then the per-unit cost will be 5.26, and the tax will be 45 And above 200, the cost of the unit is 8.45, and the tax is 75.

Units = int(input(" Please enter the amount of units you consumed:"))

if(Units< 50):
    amount = Units * 260
    surcharge = 25

elif(Units <= 100):
    amount = 130 + ((Units - 50) * 3.25)
    surcharge = 45

elif(Units <= 200):
    amount = 130 + 162.50 + ((Units - 100) * 5.26)
    surcharge = 45

else:
    amount = 130 + 162.50 + 526 + ((Units - 200) *8.45)
    surcharge = 75
